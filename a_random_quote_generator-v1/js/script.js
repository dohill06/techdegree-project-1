  Create the array of quote objects and name it `quotes`.
  Add at least five quote objects to the `quotes` array.
  Give each quote object a `quote` and `source` property.

  Recommended: 
    - Add at least one `year` and/or `citation` property to at least one 
      quote object.

  Create the `printQuote` function to: 
   - call the `getRandomQuote` function and assign it to a variable.
   - use the properties of the quote object stored in the variable to 
     create your HTML string.
   - use conditionals to make sure the optional properties exist before 
     they are added to the HTML string.
   - set the `innerHTML` of the `quote-box` div to the HTML string.
